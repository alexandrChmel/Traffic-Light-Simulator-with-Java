<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Creating a whole system at once is challenging, so we will start with a simple stopwatch in the new thread.</p>
<p>Let's assume that our program has three possible states:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not Started </strong>— the state until the initial settings have been provided;</li>
<li><strong>Menu</strong> — the state we worked with earlier. It shows possible options and processes the user's input;</li>
<li><strong>System </strong>— the state that shows the user information about our traffic light, such as time from startup and initial settings for now.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the user provided input for initial settings (both the number of roads and the interval), create a new thread to implement the <strong>System </strong>state. Name it as <code class="java">QueueThread</code> by calling its <code class="java">setName()</code> method with the corresponding string argument. The actions this newly-created thread should perform for now each second are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing the variable that corresponds to the amount of time since the "system startup" each second (1000 milliseconds);</li>
<li>(if in System state)<strong> </strong>Printing the system information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's add new functionality to the <code class="java">Open system</code> menu option. By choosing <code class="java">3</code> option in Menu,<strong> </strong>the program switches to the System state, and the <strong>main thread waits for input from the user</strong>. To return to the Menu state, the user should press Enter, in other words, an empty string should be provided as input.</p>
<p>Example of system information output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">! 3s. have passed since system startup !
! Number of roads: 1 !
! Interval: 1 !
! Press "Enter" to open menu !</code></pre>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">From this stage and beyond, the testing process can take some time.</div>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Implement the System state as described above and set its thread name as <code class="java">QueueThread</code>. While your program is in the System state, the output should contain the following information, updated (printing out) each second:</p>
<ol>
<li>The line that shows the time since the program's start (contains only one integer — the number of seconds);</li>
<li>The line that indicates the number of roads provided by the user (includes the <code class="java"><span style="color: #000000;">number</span></code> substring and only one integer — the same value that was provided in the settings);</li>
<li>The line that shows the interval provided by the user (contains the <code class="java"><span style="color: #000000;">interval</span></code> substring and only one integer — the same value that was provided in the settings);</li>
<li>The line that asks the user to press Enter to open the menu (should contain the <code class="java"><span style="color: #000000;">Enter</span></code> substring)</li>
</ol>
<p>When the user provided an empty input, the program should switch back to the Menu state and show the previously implemented menu.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">The created <code class="java">QueueThread</code> thread should be terminated when the program is finished.</div>

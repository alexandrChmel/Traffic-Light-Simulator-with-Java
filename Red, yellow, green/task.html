<p></p><h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>So far, the information on which roads are part of the road junction means nothing to a driver and does not help users to control traffic. In this stage, we will finish our traffic management system. As a result, the system will control a set of roads, opening and closing them at intervals specified by the user.</p><p>The program first welcomes the user and prompts them to input the number of roads and the interval between the opening and closing of each road. Then the control panel with menu is displayed.</p><p>Let's consider a scenario where we want to control 4 roads, with an interval of 8 seconds. We add all the roads sequentially via the <code class="java">1. Add</code> option: <code class="java">"First"</code>, <code class="java">"Second"</code>, <code class="java">"Third"</code>, <code class="java">"Fourth"</code>. After all the roads are added and the interval has been specified, we can start our system with <code class="java">3. System</code>:</p><pre><code class="java">! Number of roads: 4 !
! Interval: 8 !

Road "First" will be open for 8s.
Road "Second" will be closed for 8s.
Road "Third" will be closed for 16s.
Road "Fourth" will be closed for 24s.

! Press "Enter" to open menu !</code></pre><p>It might be difficult to understand how this system should work, so here is a brief explanation with examples:</p><p>The roads are managed using a circular queue, where the road at the front of the queue is open, and the rest are closed. In this case, <code class="java">"First"</code> was added first, so it is also the first to be open. It will remain open for the specified interval of 8 seconds before switching to the next road in line. So, <code class="java">"Second"</code> will open after <code class="java">"First"</code> in 8 seconds, <code class="java">"Third"</code> will open after <code class="java">"Second"</code> in 16 seconds, and <code class="java">"Fourth"</code> will open after <code class="java">"Third"</code> in 24 seconds.</p><p>For example, if the remaining time for <code class="java">"First"</code> is 1 second, the system will display:</p><pre><code class="java">Road "First" will be open for 1s.
Road "Second" will be closed for 1s.
Road "Third" will be closed for 9s.
Road "Fourth" will be closed for 17s.</code></pre><p>Once the timer for the open road expires, it moves to the back of the queue, and the next road becomes open:</p><pre><code class="java">Road "First" will be closed for 24s.
Road "Second" will be open for 8s.
Road "Third" will be closed for 8s.
Road "Fourth" will be closed for 16s.</code></pre><p>In this system, once the last added road, <code class="java">"Fourth"</code>, is closed, <code class="java">"First"</code> will open again, and the cycle will repeat.</p><p>Overall, the program displays the current state of each road (<code class="java">open</code>/<code class="java">close</code>) and calculates the time, until this road closes/opens.</p><p>Let's consider corner cases. The time for each road should be calculated before the information is displayed, so if a road is deleted, the time for the other roads will change. Let's say we've just deleted one road from system. The next output (after 1 second) will be:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Road "First" will be closed for 15s
Road "Second" will be open for 7s.
Road "Third" will be closed for 7s.</code></pre><p>Similarly, the time for other roads will change when adding roads.</p><p>Let's continue exploring our example. If the opened road is deleted, there should be no roads in state <code class="java">open</code><em> </em>until the next one opens. Let's say we've just deleted two roads from system (sequentially). The next output (after 1 second) will be:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Road "Third" will be closed for 6s.</code></pre><p>Output after 6 more seconds will be:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Road "Third" will be open for 6s.</code></pre><p>If the only road that exists is the opened one - it should never close (its state should be always <code class="java">open</code>), but still should count down the time to close, so the output after 7 seconds will be:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Road "Third" will be open for 5s.</code></pre><p>When there are no roads in the system, the next added road must be open for an interval. Let's say we've deleted last road from system, leaving it empty and added one more road. The next output will be:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Road "Fifth" will be open for 8s.</code></pre><p>Also, you might want to make your program more user-friendly and beautiful. You can achieve it by adding color to the output â€” green, yellow, and red with these ANSI color codes:</p><p>ANSI_RED = <code class="java">"\u001B[31m"</code><br/>ANSI_GREEN = <code class="java">"\u001B[32m"</code><br/>ANSI_YELLOW = <code class="java">"\u001B[33m"</code><br/>ANSI_RESET = <code class="java">"\u001B[0m"</code></p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">System.out.println("\u001B[32m" + "Hello World!" + "\u001B[0m");</code></pre><p>The snippet above will give you <code class="java">Hello World!</code></p><h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5><p>Your task for the final stage will be to add the road's state and timing information to each of the elements in <strong>System mode</strong>. Add the <code class="java">open</code>/<code class="java">close</code> substring, according to it's state and calculate the time, until this road switches to another state. </p><h5 id="example">Example</h5><p><strong>Example</strong>:</p><p><picture><img alt="" height="1080" src="https://ucarecdn.com/5de40617-d3c0-4653-92dd-ef03e1f40033/" width="1920"/></picture></p><details><summary>Transcription</summary><div><pre><code class="language-no-highlight"># Since the structure of the output does not change in this stage, this transcription will contain only actions and road states each second.

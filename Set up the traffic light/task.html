<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>What is a system without parameters? The traffic light should work the way users want it. Everything is simple â€” provide input and get the corresponding program's output.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>In this stage, after the welcoming line, ask the users to <code class="java">input</code> the desired <code class="java">number</code> of roads and <code class="java">input</code> the <code class="java">interval</code> at which the roads should open/close. After each request, read the value that a user provides.</p>
<p>Next, implement a looped selection menu. The loop (as well as the program execution) ends when a user selects <code class="java">0</code> as the desired option. Any other option (<code class="java">1</code>, <code class="java">2</code>, <code class="java">3</code>) prints an informational text on the action performed (<code class="java">add</code>, <code class="java">delete</code>, <code class="java">system</code>) for each option.</p>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Welcome to the traffic management system!
